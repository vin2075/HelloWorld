  

I am a passionate and results-driven Software Engineer Intern at Fusion Pact, eager to apply my technical skills and problem-solving abilities to real-world challenges. With a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and full-stack development, I specialize in building scalable and efficient software solutions.  

My expertise spans Java, Python, and JavaScript, along with hands-on experience in frameworks like React.js, Node.js, and Django. I am also proficient in cloud technologies, particularly AWS, and have worked with databases like MySQL and MongoDB. During my internship, I have contributed to designing, developing, and optimizing software applications, ensuring high performance and maintainability.  

Beyond coding, I enjoy tackling complex problems, collaborating in agile teams, and continuously learning new technologies. I have a keen interest in system design, DevOps, and security, striving to enhance my knowledge in these domains.  

Previously, I interned at KodNest Technologies, where I honed my skills in full-stack development and automation testing. Additionally, I have worked on projects involving feedback analytics and scalable web applications.
